# Gene expression in the Brain
UMich STATS 604: Project 2

## Team Members
- Ben Agyare
- Yumeng Wang
- Jake Trauger
- Yash Patel

## Goal
Find genes that are differentially expressed between
1. males and females
2. ACC and DLPFC

## Context
You are the statistical collaborator to the lab that produced this data
this initial study is "exploratory"
, or "hypothesis generating"
a further "confirmatory" study will be run to validate the candidate DE genes
the confirmatory assays are run one gene at a time, and are expensive
at most 20 genes will be followed up on

In other words,
you want to be sure you've got good candidate genes before running the confirmatory study
you want to be able to communicate to your collaborators how confident you are about individual
genes, so they can decide which genes are worth pursuing
